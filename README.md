**Tejas Rao - ME19B179**

Various Path Planning Algorithms implemented to solve the issues related to RCM (Remote Centre of Motion) of a surgical robot. All the simulations are done using the KUKA iiwa 7 robot package on Gazebo.

Gen Instructions:

- The algorithm folder, can be used, but code in deployment in RCM_Project/....../catkin_ws/src/iiwa_stack/iiwa_moveit/scripts.
- To be similarly mirrored in HOME/catkin_ws
